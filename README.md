System-Programming-SICXE-Project
========================================
Sogang Univ. System Programming (CSE4100) - SIC/XE Machine Project

[Project 1 - Shell Prompt & Opcode Table & Memory Manager](https://github.com/taeguk/System-Programming-SICXE-Project/tree/project-1)
-----------------
- Shell Prompt
  - Command History Management
  - Command 'dir' (similar to Unix's 'ls')
- SIC/XE Instruction Opcode Table
- SIC/XE Memory Manager (edit, fill, dump)
- Generic Linked List
 
 [Project 2 - Assembler](https://github.com/taeguk/System-Programming-SICXE-Project/tree/project-2)
----------------
- Assemble SIC/XE assembly code (.asm). 
- As a result, generate listing file (.lst) and object file (.obj).
- Not all assembly features are supported.

[Project 3 - Linking Loader & Runner & Debugger](https://github.com/taeguk/System-Programming-SICXE-Project/tree/project-3)
---------------------
- Linking Loader
  - Link several object files and load the program into specific memory address.
- Runner
  - Emulate SIC/XE machine.
  - Run SIC/XE program loaded in memory.
  - Not all instructions are implemented.
- Debugger
  - Break point
  
Limitation
----------------
This project is just for an assignment of System Programming (CSE4100) course. <br/>
I didn't spend much time. So, exception handling is lacking. And some codes and design are inefficient and bad.
